###Introduction

 
The City of Austin has developed a draft proposed Corridor Construction Program composed of mobility improvements on nine major roadways, or corridors, throughout Austin. Click here to view the draft proposed Corridor Construction Program.

Test Test

The draft proposed Corridor Construction Program is intended to address some of Austin’s biggest mobility challenges by:

Expanding transportation options by improving the safety and connectivity of Austin’s sidewalk and bicycle networks
Getting people moving by increasing the amount of people who can travel through the corridor
Reducing crashes through safety improvements to intersections and along the roadway

The corridors included in the draft proposed Corridor Construction Program were listed on the 2016 Bond Election ballot, on which voters decided in November 2016.

The proposed improvements on the corridors are based on recommendations in Corridor Mobility Plans for each of the corridors, which the City of Austin has been developing with the help of the community since 2011.

The draft proposed Corridor Construction Program is the result of feedback from thousands of residents and direction on how to prioritize the improvements in the Contract With Voters. Learn more about public input and outreach here.

##Funding

The proposed Corridor Construction Program will be funded by the 2016 Mobility Bond, which allocates $482 million for corridor improvement projects, as well as other funding sources.

Because the cost to engineer, design, and construct all the recommendations in the Corridor Mobility Plans would exceed $1 billion, the Austin City Council directed City of Austin staff to prioritize the recommendations into a proposed Corridor Construction Program.

This direction may be found in the Contract With Voters, which is a legally binding document that was approved by the Austin City Council 2016, prior to passage of the 2016 Mobility Bond.

## What's Next


The Council must approve the Corridor Construction Program before any construction funding is appropriated to the projects or construction begins.

City of Austin staff plans to go to Council with the proposed Corridor Construction Program in March 2018. Click here to view the draft proposed Corridor Construction Program.

The improvements in the proposed Corridor Construction Program are still conceptual, or at 5%-15% design. Project development, including further engineering and design, still need to take place.

Future engineering and design activities will include:

Ongoing coordination with the community and businesses
Surveying the project areas to refine information about right-of-way, existing utilities (such as underground water and electrical lines, or power line poles), and other constraints that may impact how the improvements are designed and built
Evaluation of how to sequence the projects to mitigate impacts to businesses, neighborhoods, and people traveling along the corridor

Due to some of the information that may be discovered during future engineering and design, an improvement into the proposed Corridor Construction Program may NOT be constructed with funding from the 2016 Mobility Bond because it may be too expensive or take too long. Additional funding will be sought for corridor improvements.

See Project Phases below for more information about activities that will take place at each phase of the project and where we are now in project development.

The Corridor Construction Program, once approved by the Austin City Council, will be implemented within the next seven years, as directed by the Contract With Voters. See the program timeline below for more information about implementation.
